# clickr coding test

- I only used Poppins font for the whole page according to Figma style guide (no Roboto, Outfit font)
- In wider screen than 1280px, the content of page will look narrow or different with Figma mock due to max width set to sections
- Menu items are not match with sections. So I just anchored to random sections.
